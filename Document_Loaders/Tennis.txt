Tennis is a popular sport played worldwide, known for its combination of physical skill, strategy, and mental toughness. It is typically played between two players (singles) or two teams of two players (doubles) on a rectangular court divided by a net. Players use rackets to hit a felt-covered rubber ball back and forth, aiming to score points when their opponent fails to return the ball within the court’s boundaries. Tennis requires speed, agility, endurance, and precise hand-eye coordination. Beyond physical ability, players must also develop strong tactical thinking to anticipate opponents’ moves, making it both a mental and physical game.
